# Hydra SDK Overview

The Hydra SDK is a comprehensive toolkit for building secure, distributed applications with advanced cryptographic features. It provides a range of modules for virtual file systems, cryptographic operations, quantum-resistant algorithms, and more.

## Core Features

- **Secure Virtual File System**: Store and retrieve data securely with encryption and access controls
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Resistant to attacks from quantum computers
- **Layered Matrix and Vector System**: For secure consensus and fault tolerance
- **P2P Networking**: Decentralized communication between nodes
- **Address Generation**: Create and manage cryptographic addresses for the P2P VFS
- **Container Isolation**: Secure execution environments for applications
- **Command-Line Interface**: Easy access to all functionality

## Architecture

The Hydra SDK is designed with a modular architecture, allowing developers to use only the components they need. The main modules include:

- **hydra_cli**: Command-line interface for interacting with Hydra SDK functionality
- **hydra_crypto**: Cryptographic operations including encryption, signatures, and key management
- **hydra_vfs**: Virtual File System for secure storage and retrieval of data
- **hydra_address**: Address generation and management for the P2P VFS
- **hydra_qzkp**: Quantum Zero-Knowledge Proofs for secure verification
- **hydra_kernel**: Container process isolation for secure execution environments
- **hydra_lmvs**: Layered Matrix and Vector System for secure consensus and fault tolerance
- **hydra_math**: Mathematical utilities including BigInt and matrix operations
- **hydra_compression**: Data compression algorithms for efficient storage and transmission

## Use Cases

The Hydra SDK is designed for a wide range of applications, including:

- **Decentralized Applications**: Build applications that run on a distributed network
- **Secure Storage**: Store sensitive data with strong encryption and access controls
- **Quantum-Resistant Systems**: Prepare for the post-quantum era with resistant algorithms
- **Secure Communication**: Establish secure channels between nodes
- **Geospatial Applications**: Use geohashed addresses for location-based services
- **Resource Management**: Track and manage resources in a distributed system

## Getting Started

To get started with the Hydra SDK, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Build the SDK from source or use pre-built binaries
2. **Configuration**: Set up your environment and configure the SDK
3. **Exploration**: Use the CLI to explore the available functionality
4. **Integration**: Integrate the SDK into your applications

For detailed instructions, see the [Installation](installation.md) and [Getting Started](getting_started.md) guides.
