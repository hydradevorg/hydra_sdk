# Hydra Quantum Virtual Machine

## Overview

The `hydra_qtm_vm` module is a quantum computing simulator designed to provide a C++ implementation of quantum circuit simulation capabilities similar to Qiskit Aer. This module enables the simulation of quantum algorithms and circuits within the Hydra SDK, supporting quantum computing research and development without requiring access to actual quantum hardware.

## Planned Features

### Qubit System & State Representation
- Support for arbitrary number of qubits (`n`)
- Full state vector representation with `2^n` complex amplitudes
- Tensor product state composition
- State normalization enforcement
- Basis state labeling (e.g., |000⟩, |101⟩)

### Quantum Gate Support

#### Single-Qubit Gates
- Identity `I`
- Pauli gates: `X`, `Y`, `Z`
- Hadamard `H`
- Phase gates: `S`, `S†`, `T`, `T†`
- Arbitrary unitary gate `U(θ, φ, λ)`

#### Multi-Qubit Gates
- CNOT
- CZ
- SWAP
- Controlled-U
- Toffoli (CCX)

#### Gate Operations
- Tensor product gate construction
- Matrix exponentiation for time evolution
- Controlled gate applications

### Measurement & Collapse
- Single-qubit measurement with probabilistic collapse
- Multi-qubit measurement in computational basis
- Multi-shot measurement simulation
- Measurement outcome histogram
- Classical register mapping for measured bits

### Classical Register Support
- Classical bit register to hold measured values
- Conditional gate execution based on classical bits
- Read/write access to classical bits

### Circuit Building & Execution
- Abstract `QuantumCircuit` object
- Gate operation queue system
- Ordered execution of gates
- Basic optimization of redundant/no-op gates

### Simulation Configuration
- Configurable number of shots
- Simulation seed for reproducibility
- Noise models and error simulation
- Performance optimization options

## Integration with Hydra SDK

The `hydra_qtm_vm` module will integrate with other components of the Hydra SDK:

- **hydra_math**: Leveraging the mathematical libraries for complex matrix operations
- **hydra_crypto**: Supporting post-quantum cryptographic algorithms
- **hydra_kernel**: Running quantum simulations within isolated processes

## Planned Implementation

The module will be implemented in C++20 with the following components:

- High-performance linear algebra using Eigen library
- Optimized state vector operations
- Multi-threading support for parallel simulation
- Memory-efficient representation of quantum states

## Usage Examples (Planned)

```cpp
// Example quantum circuit creation and simulation (future API)
#include "hydra_qtm_vm/quantum_circuit.hpp"
#include "hydra_qtm_vm/simulator.hpp"
#include <iostream>

using namespace hydra::quantum;

int main() {
    // Create a 3-qubit circuit
    QuantumCircuit circuit(3, 3);  // 3 qubits, 3 classical bits
    
    // Apply gates
    circuit.h(0);        // Hadamard on qubit 0
    circuit.cx(0, 1);    // CNOT with control qubit 0, target qubit 1
    circuit.cx(0, 2);    // CNOT with control qubit 0, target qubit 2
    
    // Measure qubits to classical bits
    circuit.measure(0, 0);
    circuit.measure(1, 1);
    circuit.measure(2, 2);
    
    // Create a simulator and run the circuit
    Simulator sim;
    auto result = sim.run(circuit, 1024);  // Run 1024 shots
    
    // Print the measurement counts
    auto counts = result.get_counts();
    for (const auto& [bitstring, count] : counts) {
        std::cout << bitstring << ": " << count << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
