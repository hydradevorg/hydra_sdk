# Hydra CLI Address Generation

The Hydra CLI provides a powerful address generation system for the P2P VFS, implementing the Layered Matrix and Vector System for secure consensus, fault tolerance, and data projection.

## Overview

The address generation functionality in the Hydra CLI allows you to:

- Generate standard addresses from public keys
- Create geohashed addresses with location data
- Generate quantum-resistant addresses
- Create compressed addresses (< 100 bytes)
- Verify addresses and display their details
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent address generation

## Command Syntax

```bash
hydra-cli crypto address OPERATION [OPTIONS]
```

### Operations

- `standard`: Generate a standard address from a public key
- `geo`: Generate a geohashed address with location data
- `quantum`: Generate a quantum-resistant address
- `compressed`: Generate a compressed address (< 100 bytes)
- `verify`: Verify an address and display its details

### Options

- `--type TYPE`: Address type (user, node, resource, service)
- `-h, --help`: Show help message

## Address Types

The Hydra address system supports four types of addresses:

1. **User Addresses**: Used for identifying users in the P2P network
2. **Node Addresses**: Used for identifying nodes in the P2P network
3. **Resource Addresses**: Used for identifying resources in the P2P VFS
4. **Service Addresses**: Used for identifying services in the P2P network

## Address Formats

The Hydra address system supports four formats:

1. **Standard Format**: Base58-encoded address with full cryptographic properties
2. **Geohashed Format**: Includes location data for geospatial applications
3. **Quantum-Resistant Format**: Includes quantum zero-knowledge proofs for post-quantum security
4. **Compressed Format**: Ultra-compact representation (< 100 bytes) for efficient storage

## Examples

### Generating a Standard Address

```bash
# Generate a standard address for a user
hydra-cli crypto address standard --type user public_key.bin

# Generate a standard address for a node
hydra-cli crypto address standard --type node public_key.bin
```

### Generating a Geohashed Address

```bash
# Generate a geohashed address with specific coordinates
hydra-cli crypto address geo --type node 37.7749 -122.4194 public_key.bin
```

### Generating a Quantum-Resistant Address

```bash
# Generate a quantum-resistant address
hydra-cli crypto address quantum --type user public_key.bin
```

### Generating a Compressed Address

```bash
# Generate a compressed address (< 100 bytes)
hydra-cli crypto address compressed --type resource public_key.bin
```

### Verifying an Address

```bash
# Verify an address and display its details
hydra-cli crypto address verify KKkpkFRUPSe8nVeGisC5HprvmCy79niy7vep45i86YRmb5G1TzZC423UEBLGxo1x3epuT2HNh4gWAZ7LJBfXriXdfGQsji1STAg6VriSPj66pyaEw7Co1hMB14fXKuAuGAhLafR
```

## Implementation Details

The address generation system uses several cryptographic components:

1. **BLAKE3 Hashing**: For creating cryptographic hashes of public keys
2. **Falcon Signatures**: For signing address data
3. **Kyber KEM**: For encryption in quantum-resistant addresses
4. **Layered Matrix and Vector System**: For secure consensus and fault tolerance
5. **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**: For efficient compression of address data

### Compressed Address Format

The compressed address format uses a multi-stage compression approach:

1. **Truncation**: Reduces data to essential bytes
2. **Bit Packing**: Packs 8 bytes into 7 bytes by using only 7 bits per byte
3. **Run-Length Encoding**: Compresses repeated sequences
4. **Size Limiting**: Enforces a maximum size of 99 bytes

This approach ensures that addresses are compact while maintaining sufficient entropy for uniqueness.

## API Integration

The address generation functionality can also be integrated into your applications using the Hydra SDK API:

```cpp
#include <hydra_address/address_generator.hpp>

// Create an address generator
hydra::address::AddressGenerator address_gen;

// Generate a compressed address
auto address = address_gen.generateCompressedAddress(
    public_key,
    hydra::address::AddressType::RESOURCE
);

// Get the address as a string
std::string address_str = address.toString();

// Verify the address
bool is_valid = address_gen.verifyAddress(address);
```

## Security Considerations

- Always verify addresses before using them in critical operations
- Compressed addresses use a lossy compression algorithm, which may reduce the security level slightly
- Quantum-resistant addresses provide protection against quantum computing attacks
- Geohashed addresses reveal location information, so use them only when appropriate
